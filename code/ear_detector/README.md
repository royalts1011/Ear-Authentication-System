## _earDetection.py_
    * Start this script for real time object detection without the process of saving images for a dataset.
    * When running, press `esc` to quit and `p` to save the current bounding box as a _.png_ image
## _acquire_ear_dataset.py_
    * Running the script will ask for a name input to save images of the detected object.
    * The script is also called in _authentication_-mode from the embedding_system. It will then choose name 'unknown' and save images to a 'unknown-auth' folder.
